## My Algorithm Journey
Some basic algorithms and data structures would appear here in this repo. Each time I encounter one and solve it, I'll push to this repo to keep track of my progress and also for you all coming here to learn too

<h3>Note:</h3>
This repo is for learning purposes

<h2>Algorithms</h2>
Algorithm is a set of rules precisely define a sequence of operations 

<h2>Data Structures</h2>
A data structure is a particular way of organizing and storing data in a computer so that it can be accessed and modified efficiently.
